## Web Frameworks

*   [**Gin**](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) - Arguably the most popular and widely used Go web framework. Although it has a Martini-like API, it is extremely fast thanks to its Radix tree-based routing. It has a large community and a rich ecosystem of middleware. It is one of the safest starting points for new projects.
*   [**Fiber**](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) - A framework that is extremely easy and enjoyable to use, strongly inspired by Express.js from the Node.js world. It is built on top of **`fasthttp`** instead of Go's standard `net/http` package, making it one of the fastest web frameworks available. It is very easy to adapt for developers with Express experience.
*   [**Echo**](https://github.com/labstack/echo) - Another popular high-performance, minimalist, and extensible framework. It features a powerful router, a rich set of middleware, and built-in support for template rendering. It is often mentioned alongside Gin and Fiber as one of the best minimalist frameworks.
*   [**Chi**](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) - Stands out for being lightweight, idiomatic, and composable. The biggest advantage of `chi` is its full compatibility with Go's standard `net/http` package. This means you can use existing `net/http`-compatible middleware without any changes. It is one of the frameworks most faithful to Go's philosophy.
*   [**Gorilla/Mux**](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) - One of the oldest and most established routers in Go. It is more of a powerful router and dispatcher than a full-fledged framework. It forms the basis of many large and legacy projects. It is known for its flexible routing rules and robustness. Although it is now community-managed, it is still very common.
## Database

_ORM and Database Tools_

*   [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) - A developer-friendly, full-featured ORM library for Go.
